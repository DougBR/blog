This is a ritualistic performance in the art of learning new technologies.
Developers around the world know the truth: if you dare to write your first lines of code
without a `Hello World` statement, you're inviting a curse upon your journey.

Expect mysterious bugs to infest your codebase, builds to fail without reason,
and cryptic errors to appear on line 23 — even if that line doesn’t exist.

So, to honor the programming gods, I'm beginning my first [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) experience
with the sacred tradition: a `Hello World` post.
